##  Overview  

This application dives into two sibling API's, one targeting meal recipes (https://www.themealdb.com) and one targeting drink recipes (https://www.thecocktaildb.com) and can pull at random from both and present them with picture, ingredients, instructions and even a how-to YouTube video if it exists!

##  How to Use the Project

On the click of a single button can generate 1 random meal and drink recipe to take out the planning of a stay-at-home date night! With preferences, you can choose up to 13 different types of food to condense the pool of search results and choose from alcoholic or non-alcoholic to do the same with the drinks!

 ## The Future
Eventually, we would like to have more interaction with the cards that are generated on the website. We would like the user to be able to dive into any listed drop down category and choose from a list of dynamically created cards of ALL the available recipes of that category. (i.e. Click on the "Beef" category would dynamically create a card for every available recipe with beef in it for the user to browse and use. Save what the like into "Favorites" for future use. Lastly a comments section to review recipes for future users, or changes and additions that they made to make things better!)
