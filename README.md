##  Overview  

This application dives into two sibling API's, one targeting meal recipes (https://www.themealdb.com) and one targeting drink recipes (https://www.thecocktaildb.com) and can pull at random from both and present them with picture, ingredients, instructions and even a how-to YouTube video if it exists!

##  How to Use the Project

On the click of a single button can generate 1 random meal and drink recipe to take out the planning of a stay-at-home date night! With preferences, you can choose up to 13 different types of food to condense the pool of search results and choose from alcoholic or non-alcoholic to do the same with the drinks!
