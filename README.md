##  Overview  

This application dives into two sibling API's, one targeting meal recipes (https://www.themealdb.com) and one targeting drink recipes (https://www.thecocktaildb.com) and can pull at random from both and present them with picture, ingredients, instructions and even a how-to YouTube video if it exists!

## Features

    1. First it listens for the DOMContentLoaded event to ensure the page is fully loaded before executing the script.
    
    2. Reaches into two seperate API data bases simutaneously and runs seperate random number generator code to pull out random indexes from both API's.

    3. Has a "Save" feature, using local storage to grab and store the combination of food and drinks that the user would like to revisit, makeing it a revisitable button.

    4. Uses drop down menus to narrow the random generator to specific categories to adhere to user preferences.

 ## The Future
Eventually, we would like to have more interaction with the cards that are generated on the website. We would like the user to be able to dive into any listed drop down category and choose from a list of dynamically created cards of ALL the available recipes of that category. (i.e. Click on the "Beef" category would dynamically create a card for every available recipe with beef in it for the user to browse and use. Save what the like into "Favorites" for future use. Lastly a comments section to review recipes for future users, or changes and additions that they made to make things better!)
